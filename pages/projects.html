          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>In my first year of SIAT I took a class centred around digital games, genre, structure, programming, and play. I was required to make a game using Processing and incorporate all the concepts we had learned that term into the game. I decided to use my love for Pokémon to create a Pokémon Café game.</p>

          <h3>Phase 1 - Character Design</h3>
          <p>Once I knew what my topic was, I began to implement the function behind the assignment. As someone who comes from more of a computer science background, I like to ensure all the functions work before I think about the visual design of a project. In Fig.4 I use an ellipse in place of an image as it works as a quick placeholder for the object that will be implemented at a later time.</p>

          <h3>Phase 2 - Bare Bones Design</h3>
          <p>Once I have the base functions working, I begin to implement the layout and design of the game. I started using base shapes that are including in Processing such as ellipses and rectangles. As I get more of the function up to par, I slowly introduce graphics that I created using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

          <h3>Phase 3 - Feature Implementation</h3>
          <p>Once I began to implement some graphics, I realized that the game starts to feel too easy very quickly. In Fig. 7 is where I decided to add some difficulty scaling with the game, as well as a strike system so that players are limited in the number of mistakes they may make, and the game increases in difficulty as time goes on. This ensures there is some pressure as the player improves, and does not result in an infinite length game.</p>

          <h3>Phase 4 - Game Completion</h3>
          <p>Now that the function is complete, I started off with creating my graphics. The graphic requirements for the assignment allowed us to use assets from online, however I wanted to keep a certain pastel-coloured, no-outline appearance. This led me to re-create a few Pokémon by tracing the original artwork within Adobe Illustrator. The rest of the assets were created free-hand in illustrator as well, however not borrowed a character from an existing IP. </p>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>In my 5th year in IAT, I took an advanced game design class where throughout the entirety of the school term, we slowly developed a game using Unity. This project was a collaborative effort, however I was appointed project manager, as well as assiting with coding the animations, UI, creating some of the graphics, writing the story, as well as being one of the main gameplay designers.</p>

          <h3>Phase 1 - Basic Mechanics</h3>
          <p>In the start we established we were going for a dungeon crawler/bullet hell like game, similar to Binding of Isaac. We begun our development with shapes as placeholders, while trying to code the basics of the games mechanics such as movement and attacking using C#.</p>

          <h3>Phase 2 - Environment Graphics</h3>
          <p>Once we got a handle on some basic mechanics, we decided we needed to include some graphics into the game. I asked our main artists to create some basic sprites for us to begin building our game world, which started off as a large room.</p>

          <h3>Phase 3 - Character Design</h3>
          <p>Through many talks with the team, we established that we wanted our main playable character to be a cute cat with an arsenal of weapons. The cat is equipped with random weapons found in a household, and his main goal is to escape the hosue by navigating through the map and clearing the enemies in each room</p>

          <h3>Phase 4 - Map Development</h3>
          <p>Once we got the basics down, we felt it would be necessary to create a map layout. Originlly we wanted to have a randomly generated map layout, but were unable to get it to function correctly in the amount of time we were given, we landed on the following design for the first level of our game.</p>

          <h3>Phase 5 - Story Development</h3>
          <p>With much feedback, we were given the impression our game would be strongly driven by funny and cute dialogue to drive the direction of our game. I wrote out a script including 4 cut scenes, for our artists to draw the frames for, after which I edited a video for each with sound effects and our other programmer coded into the game between levels.</p>

          <h3>Phase 6 - Final Code</h3>
          <p>Everything brought together, made our game CAT-astrophe, a cute dungeon-crawler game with quirky mobs and goofy attacks. The game went through 4 different phases of gametesting before we landed on a difficulty we were happy with.</p>

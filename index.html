    <h3>Hi! I'm <span>Alexandria</span>, but you can call me <span>Ally</span>.</h3>
    <p>I’m a 22-year-old IAT student with an interest in game design! I started playing Mario Party on the GameCube when I was 4 years old. Ever since then gaming has been a huge part of my life and my love for games is what led me to SFU’s School of Interactive Art and Technology (SIAT). I try to bring the games (or movies) I’m passionate about, into anywhere I can. This means I reference Disney movies, or games such as VALORANT or Pokémon in my work and occasionally sneak in a frog or two
    </p>
    <p>I have experience in Java, Processing, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL,  and JQuery, but I'm always open to learn as required!</p>
    <p>I'm looking for a position as a junior software developer or junior back-end web developer in the Greater Vancouver area.</p>
